# Recordstore: Ruby on Rails API with Vue.js

## What is the idea?
Build a basic application with a API that allows a front-end client (Vue.js in this case) create user sessions and registrations using [JWT](https://jwt.io/) and create Artists and Records for authenticated users.

## Sources & Guides
* [jwt-sessions](https://github.com/tuwukee/jwt_sessions) gem for build users authentication system.
* [Web-Crunch cast videos](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eUedqaHS4RQ&t=96s).
* Posts by author of jwt-sessions that have helped me to understand all theory wrapped-in.
